		<h1>Horse Riding</h1>
		<p> I started riding Horses at a very young age and have loved it ever since.
		 I am fortunate enough to have competed at All Ireland level. I competed with the <a href="http://duhallowponyclub.ie/">Duhallow Pony Club</a> both in teams and individually.
		 In recent years I have decided to stop competing and ride more for leisure. 
		 I am lucky enough to continue to have horses during college thanks to having a family all interested in horses. I am also a member of the UCC Equestrian Club which is a great way to make friends with similar interests. </p>

            <h1>Rugby</h1>
            <p>Even though I don't play rugby myself I have a keen interest in following this sport.
               I watch all the Six Nations matches and have a family who has a huge interest in this sport.
               As a transition year student I took a course that qualifies me to train rugby up until a u13 level.  </p>
            <br></br>
            <h1>Basketball</h1>
            <p>I used to play basketball for the club in Mallow. We won the county final in 2015 and got into the all Ireland play offs.
            I would love to go back playing basketball in the future.</p>
